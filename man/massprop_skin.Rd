\usage{
massprop_skin(m, rho, pts)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{Mass of skin (kg)}

\item{rho}{Density of skin (kg/m^3)}

\item{pts}{Three points that define the vertices of the triangle. Frame of reference: VRP | Origin: VRP
Must be numbered in a counterclockwise direction for positive area, otherwise signs will be reversed.
each point should be a different row as follows:
\item{pt1x, pt1y, pt1z}
\item{pt2x, pt1y, pt2z}
\item{pt3x, pt3y, pt3z}
For inner skin: Pt1 - Shoulder, Pt2 - Wrist, Pt3 - Elbow * ensures CCW ordering
For outer skin: Pt1 - Wrist, Pt2 - Finger, Pt3 - Elbow * ensures CCW ordering}
}
\value{
This function returns a list that includes:
point mass
\item{I}{a 3x3 matrix representing the moment of inertia tensor of skin modelled as a flat triangular plate}
\item{CG}{a 1x3 vector representing the center of gravity position of skin modelled as a flat triangular plate}
}
\description{
Calculate the moment of inertia of skin modelled as a flat triangular plate
}
\section{Warning}{

Parallel axis theorem does not apply between two arbitrary points. One point must be the object's center of gravity.
