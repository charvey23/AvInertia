\title{Compute the inertia of the individual feathers}
\usage{
compute_feat_inertia(dat_mat, dat_feat_curr, dat_bird_curr)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat_mat}{Dataframe related to the current species input as a
dataframe with the following structure:
\itemize{
\item{material}{Material information. Must include the following:
"Cortex", "Medullary"}
\item{density}{Density of each material (kg/m^3)}
}}

\item{dat_feat_curr}{Dataframe related to the current bird wing feathers
input as a dataframe with the following structure:
\itemize{
\item{feather}{Feather ID code. Must be in standard format i.e.
1st primary is "P1", third secondary is "S3", etc.
Alula feathers should be grouped and named "alula".}
\item{m_f}{Mass of feather in the same row as the
appropriate feather ID code (kg)}
\item{l_cal}{Length of calamus in the same row as the
appropriate feather ID code (m)}
\item{l_vane}{Length of rachis/vane in the same row as the
appropriate feather ID code (m)}
\item{w_cal}{Width (diameter) of calamus in the same row as the
appropriate feather ID code (m)}
\item{w_vp}{Width of proximal vane (average value) in the same row as the
appropriate feather ID code (m)}
\item{w_vd}{Width of distal vane (average value)  in the same row as the
appropriate feather ID code (m)}
\item{vane_angle}{Interior angle between the rachis and calamus  (degrees)}
}
NOTE: Alula feathers will be treated as point mass so only the mass of the
feathers is required. Other columns can be left blank.}

\item{dat_bird_curr}{Dataframe related to the current bird wing that must
include the following columns:
\itemize{
\item{barb_radius}{Radius of feather barb  for current species (m)}
\item{barb_distance}{Distance between feather barbs for current species (m)}
}}
