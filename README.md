# AvInertia: Calculate a bird's inertial properties

This package was developed to compute the center of gravity and moment of inertia tensor of any flying bird. 
It functions by modelling a bird as a composite structure of simple geometric objects. 

# Installation
You can install AvInertia from CRAN via:
