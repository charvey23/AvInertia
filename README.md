AvInertia
================

This package was developed to compute the center of gravity and moment
of inertia tensor of any flying bird. It functions by modeling a bird as
a composite structure of simple geometric objects. This requires
detailed morphological measurements of bird specimens although those
obtained for the associated paper have been included in the package for
use. Refer to the vignette and supplementary material for detailed
information on the package function.

## Installation

``` r
install.packages("AvInertia")
```

Or to get the latest (developmental) version through GitHub, use:

``` r
