# AvInertia: Calculate a bird's inertial properties

This package was developed to compute the center of gravity and moment of inertia tensor of any flying bird. 
It functions by modelling a bird as a composite structure of simple geometric objects. 

#Installation
You can install AvInertia from CRAN via:


#Documentation
Morphological measurements of the target specimen are necessary and the specific items are outlined in the supplementary methods.
