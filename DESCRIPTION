Description: 
    This package was developed to compute the center of gravity and moment of 
    inertia tensor of any flying bird. It functions by modeling a bird as a 
    composite structure of simple geometric objects. This requires detailed 
    morphological measurements of bird specimens although those obtained for 
    the associated paper have been included in the package for use. Refer to 
    the vignettes and supplementary material for detailed information on the 
    package function.
