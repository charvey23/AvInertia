Description: This package was developed to compute the center of gravity 
and moment of inertia tensor of any flying bird. It functions by modelling 
a bird as a composite structure of simple geometric objects. This requires
detailed morphological measurements of bird specimens although those obtained 
for the associated paper have been included in the package for use. Refer to the
vignettes and supplementary material for detailed information on the package 
function.
